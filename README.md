Easy setup Bliss OS builds on Linux:

```
bash setup_iso.sh <path_to_iso>
```

or copy .iso to /updates and run the script

```
bash setup_iso.sh
```

If you already have Bliss OS installed on your Linux machine following our manual Linux install, 
you can also just run the install_session.sh script to install the qemu based Linux session files. 

```
install_session.sh
```
